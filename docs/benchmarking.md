# Benchmarking Tokenless

This document records the benchmark protocol used for Tokenless API-body
measurements. The goal is to measure what enters Claude Code API requests, not
just local hook-side compression estimates.

## Measurement source

Use raw Claude Code API body logs:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES="file:<api-body-dir>"
```

Then inspect the captured request bodies:

```bash
node plugins/claude-code/bin/tokenless api-probe stats \
  --dir "<api-body-dir>" \
  --data-dir /Users/mac/.tokenless
```

Important: older variables such as `TOKENLESS_API_BODY_CAPTURE` and
`TOKENLESS_API_BODY_CAPTURE_DIR` do not capture API bodies in the current setup.

## What counts as evidence

Use `api-probe stats` request-token totals as the main comparison:

- `Estimated API body size -> request` is the primary metric.
- `all` is useful as a secondary total including responses.
- `API-confirmed savings estimate` is a counterfactual diagnostic, not exact
  billing.
- `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` appearing in request files confirms that read packets
  reached API context.
- `originalFile`, `structuredPatch`, `oldString`, and `newString` should remain
  `0` in request files. Non-zero values indicate raw edit payload leakage.

## True ON and True-OFF

Tokenless ON:

```bash
export TOKENLESS_MODE=on
```

Tokenless OFF:

```bash
export TOKENLESS_MODE=off
```

The OFF run is only valid if all packet evidence is zero:

```text
TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET: request=0
TOKENLESS-EDIT-PACKET: request=0
TOKENLESS-WRITE-PACKET: request=0
API-confirmed savings estimate: 0
```

If OFF still contains `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET`, abort the run. That is not a true
OFF comparison.

## Benchmark hygiene

- Use an immutable original fixture.
- Create fresh `on/` and `off/` copies for every pair.
- Keep the prompt realistic and fuzzy. Do not give selector-by-selector or
  component-by-component implementation instructions unless the product task
  would naturally be that specific.
- Keep ON and OFF on the same Claude Code version, provider, model aliases, and
  environment.
- Disable unrelated plugins, MCP servers, and non-Tokenless hooks for clean
  comparisons.
- Judge completion quality alongside token numbers. A cheaper run that stops
  before finishing the UI work is not a better result.

## Helper commands

Create fresh ON/OFF copies for the 10k React/TSX fixture:

```bash
node plugins/claude-code/bin/tokenless benchmark-copy aurora-10k-tsx
```

This prints:

- the fresh `on/` and `off/` directories
- the ON/OFF file paths
- matching ON/OFF launch commands
- stats commands
- the true-OFF check

Start an API probe directory without manually constructing the path:

```bash
node plugins/claude-code/bin/tokenless api-probe start --name aurora-10k-tsx-on
```

This creates a timestamped directory under `/Users/mac/.tokenless` and prints the
required environment exports, including `TOKENLESS_API_PROBE_DIR`.

Check the currently visible Tokenless mode:

```bash
TOKENLESS_MODE=off node plugins/claude-code/bin/tokenless status --user
```

The status output includes:

```text
mode: off
mode_source: TOKENLESS_MODE
```

## CSS visual-edit benchmark

Fixture family: Einstein observatory CSS page with a large `style.css`.

Prompt style: fuzzy visual polish request focused on cards, buttons, background
depth, and hover feedback while preserving cyan/orange technology styling.

Stable ON behavior:

- `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` caps the large CSS read.
- If the next step is native `Edit`, the agent performs one minimal native
  `Read` only to register editor state.
- The agent then applies 6-10 bounded `Edit` calls.
- It should not repeatedly expand or re-explore the same file.

Representative ON runs:

| API body directory | Request tokens | All tokens | Read-packet appearances |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `api-bodies-observatory-zenmux-editphase-on-20260518-052116` | 403,995 | 410,112 | 10 |
| `api-bodies-observatory-zenmux-editphase-stability2-on-20260518-052643` | 473,354 | 480,283 | 12 |
| `api-bodies-observatory-zenmux-editphase-stability3-on-20260518-053050` | 407,603 | 415,178 | 10 |

True OFF comparison:

| API body directory | Request tokens | All tokens | Read-packet appearances |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `api-bodies-observatory-zenmux-off-20260518-053825` | 1,017,642 | 1,031,745 | 0 |

Result: repeated CSS visual-edit runs reduced request-body tokens from about
1.02M to about 0.40M-0.47M, or roughly 54-60%.

## 10k React/TSX benchmark

Fixture: immutable original at:

```text
/Users/mac/aurora-ops-10k-tsx-original/src/App.tsx
```

The fixture is about 10,001 lines and roughly 76k estimated raw tokens.

Task prompt:

```text
这个 React 控制台页面现在交互和结构有点普通。你帮我把整体产品质感和可用性提升一下，重点是筛选区、指标卡、表格状态展示、侧边事件面板和按钮反馈。不要重写整个文件，不要加新依赖，保留青色和橙色的科技运营台方向。你自己判断需要改哪些代码。
```

Final clean true-OFF run:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| API body directory | `api-bodies-aurora-10k-tsx-realofffix-off-20260518-142438` |
| Request tokens | 917,137 |
| Response tokens | 29,301 |
| All tokens | 946,438 |
| Request files | 21 |
| `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` | 0 |
| `request_saved_estimate` | 0 |

Final ON run:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| API body directory | `api-bodies-aurora-10k-tsx-realofffix-on-20260518-144913` |
| Request tokens | 545,456 |
| Response tokens | 33,319 |
| All tokens | 578,775 |
| Request files | 14 |
| `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` | 11 |
| `request_saved_estimate` | 815,804 |

Raw leak checks for the ON run:

```text
originalFile: 0
structuredPatch: 0
oldString: 0
newString: 0
```

Result:

```text
Request saved: 371,681 tokens
Request reduction: 40.5%
All saved: 367,663 tokens
All reduction: 38.8%
```

The TSX path is useful but more trajectory-sensitive than CSS. The read packet
can appear in many follow-up requests, so the savings depend heavily on whether
the model edits directly from the packet or continues exploring.

## Multifile React dashboard benchmark

Fixture family: immutable original copied from:

```text
/Users/mac/aurora-ops-multifile-benchmark-original
```

The task is an agentic product-polish pass across a React dashboard with
component files, data, utilities, and a large dashboard stylesheet.

Task prompt:

```text
这个 React 运营控制台现在整体质感和可用性都偏普通。你帮我做一轮产品级提升，重点是筛选区、指标卡、表格状态展示、侧边事件面板、按钮反馈和整体视觉层次。不要重写整个项目，不要加新依赖，保留青色和橙色的科技运营台方向。你自己判断需要改哪些文件和代码。
```

### Default Lean + Tokenless ON/OFF

Both runs used the default `tokenless launch` Lean launcher, which disables
Claude Code Task/Plan tools while keeping normal read, edit, write, and bash
tools available. This isolates Tokenless ON/OFF under the current default
launcher behavior.

Tokenless OFF run:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| API body directory | `api-bodies-aurora-multifile-lean-final-off-20260518222530` |
| Request tokens | 628,261 |
| Response tokens | 29,162 |
| All tokens | 657,423 |
| Request files | 16 |
| `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` | 0 |
| `request_saved_estimate` | 0 |

Tokenless ON run:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| API body directory | `api-bodies-aurora-multifile-lean-final-on-20260518222530` |
| Request tokens | 512,521 |
| Response tokens | 20,155 |
| All tokens | 532,676 |
| Request files | 17 |
| `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` | 17 |
| `request_saved_estimate` | 647,160 |

Raw leak checks for both runs:

```text
originalFile: 0
structuredPatch: 0
oldString: 0
newString: 0
```

Result:

```text
Request saved: 115,740 tokens
Request reduction: 18.4%
All saved: 124,747 tokens
All reduction: 19.0%
```

The ON run made one more request than the OFF run, but still used fewer request
tokens overall. This confirms that the reduction did not come from simply
stopping earlier.

### Lean mode Task/Plan tool comparison

This comparison measures the launcher-level cost of allowing Claude Code
Task/Plan tools. It is product overhead reduction, not read-packet compression.

| Mode | API body directory | Request tokens | All tokens | Request files |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Task/Plan tools enabled | `api-bodies-aurora-multifile-task-on-` | 1,524,894 | 1,565,109 | 36 |
| Lean default, Task/Plan tools disabled | `api-bodies-aurora-multifile-lean-on-20260518205433` | 1,087,753 | 1,111,762 | 34 |

Result:

```text
Request saved: 437,141 tokens
Request reduction: 28.7%
All saved: 453,347 tokens
All reduction: 29.0%
```

In the Lean run, Task/Plan tool schema and Task/Plan history were absent from
request bodies. In the Task-enabled run, Task/Plan tool schema alone accounted
for about 134k request tokens. The remaining delta came from changed trajectory
and follow-up context size.

## 5-turn CRM vibe-coding benchmark

Fixture family: a React/Vite customer-growth cockpit with component files, data,
utilities, and a large stylesheet.

Immutable source:

```text
/Users/mac/.tokenless/benchmark-originals/vibe-coding-crm-20260519-044717
```

Run copies:

```text
/Users/mac/.tokenless/benchmark-runs/vibe-coding-crm-20260519-044717/coding
/Users/mac/.tokenless/benchmark-runs/vibe-coding-crm-20260519-044717/off
```

Both copies started byte-equivalent:

```text
files: 16
lines: 1188
sha256: 64812847f3f6db851ef13f2a2a8b36660bcbb608b0841378e1ffbba68e502ea7
```

Prompt style: five vague, natural-language prompts from a non-specialist user.
The user asks the agent to make an ordinary internal dashboard feel like a real
SaaS operations homepage, clarify priorities and risk, add an expansion
opportunity area, improve the account table and activity panel, and then polish
interaction feedback and mobile behavior. The prompts intentionally avoid file
names, component names, selectors, or implementation checklists.

Coding profile run:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| API body directory | `api-bodies-vibe-coding-crm-20260519-044717-coding` |
| Request tokens | 2,476,391 |
| Response tokens | 41,519 |
| All tokens | 2,517,910 |
| Request files | 51 |
| `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` | 51 |
| `request_saved_estimate` | 1,056,642 |

True OFF run:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| API body directory | `api-bodies-vibe-coding-crm-20260519-044717-off` |
| Request tokens | 4,697,867 |
| Response tokens | 74,659 |
| All tokens | 4,772,526 |
| Request files | 84 |
| `TOKENLESS-READ-PACKET` | 0 |
| `request_saved_estimate` | 0 |

Raw leak checks for both runs:

```text
originalFile: 0
structuredPatch: 0
oldString: 0
newString: 0
```

Result:

```text
Request saved: 2,221,476 tokens
Request reduction: 47.3%
Response saved: 33,140 tokens
Response reduction: 44.4%
Requests reduced: 33
Request-count reduction: 39.3%
```

Interpretation:

- The OFF run is clean: no Tokenless packets and no request-side savings
  estimate.
- The coding run combines read-packet compression with denser response style.
- The measured request-token delta is larger than the API-confirmed packet
  counterfactual because the coding profile also shortened the trajectory: 51
  requests instead of 84.
- This is the best current example for positioning Tokenless as reducing both
  context size and interactive agent drift in coding workflows.

## Notes for future README claims

Use conservative public wording:

- CSS visual-edit benchmark: about 54-60% request-token reduction.
- 10k React/TSX single-file edit: about 40% request-token reduction.
- Multifile React dashboard in the default Lean launcher: about 18% request-token
  reduction from Tokenless ON/OFF.
- Lean launcher Task/Plan tool trimming: about 29% request-token reduction in
  the multifile dashboard task family.
- 5-turn CRM vibe-coding task with the public `coding` profile: about 47%
  request-token reduction and about 39% fewer requests.
- The current strongest evidence is API request-body reduction, not exact billed
  token savings.
- Do not claim universal 80%+ savings from the current data.
